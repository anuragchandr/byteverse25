**NutriSetu** is a digital initiative dedicated to redefining how India understands and adopts nutritional practices — by making them comprehensible, accessible, and actionable for every individual.

## Overview

In the fast-paced rhythm of modern life, food is often consumed without a true understanding of nutritional needs. NutriLink aims to bridge this gap by enabling users to:

- Add and log daily food items
- Access detailed nutritional information
- Receive intelligent suggestions for balanced meal planning
- Prepare or order optimized, health-conscious meals

NutriSetu is not just a nutrition calculator — it is a thoughtful step toward building a healthier, stronger, and more informed India.

## Our Philosophy

NutriSetu is built on three fundamental principles:

- **Simplicity**  
  Nutritional data should be easy to understand, even for those without a scientific background.

- **Actionability**  
  Information must lead to meaningful and measurable changes in everyday food choices.

- **Cultural Relevance**  
  Designed with the Indian context at its core — from ingredients and cuisines to health challenges and dietary preferences.
